# shuwashuwa-superadmin
superadmin web interface

Note: to use this interface, you would probably want to put those files into `server -> src/main/resources/static`, and change base URL; or just go and resolve CORS problems lol.(Prob. with a proxy, idk)

----

Application note:

put font-awesome package into icons/ directory
put `date-fns.min.js` and `date-fns.min.js.map` into the root directory
edit `BaseURL` in `app.js`
